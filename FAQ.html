    <p> • Where is my order? •<br>
        Once your order has been dispatched from our warehouse, you’ll receive a dispatch e-mail with your tracking
        link. You can then track the parcel directly with the courier. Orders are normally dispatched within a few
        working days. If you can’t find your e-mail make sure you double check your junk/spam folders.

    <p>• How can I get a refund? •<br>
        If you change your mind for any reason, you have 90 days from the date of collection to return it to any one of
        our stores. If returning your order to one of our stores, you must provide the unique returns code you received
        on your collection email. Please ensure that your item is in its original packaging and hasn’t been opened or
        sprayed. If your item has been opened or sprayed, we will not be able to accept it back. This does not affect
        your statutory rights.
    </p>

    <p>• Can I send it as a gift? •<br>
        We offer a range of services and add ons such as engraving, gift wrapping and monogramming. See here for more
        info.
    </p>

    <p>• How do I choose a perfume I’ll really enjoy? <br>
        The fragrances you most enjoy will probably belong to just one or two of the fourteen different fragrance families. Though, like
        most good things, it takes a little effort to find a new perfume that is just right.
